    <p>Delicious mexican rice with beans.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 small poblano pepper, diced</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup basmati rice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir
        onion, poblano pepper, and garlic in hot oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add
        rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is completely coated in
        oil, about 2 minutes. Season with paprika, cumin, oregano, salt, and
        black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add vegetable broth
        and pinto beans. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer
        until rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pot from the heat, keep covered, and let stand for at least 5
        minutes. Fluff with a fork.
